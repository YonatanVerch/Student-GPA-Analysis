# Student Lifestyle & GPA Analysis (R)

**Statistical analysis of the relationship between university students’ lifestyle habits and academic performance (GPA) using survey sampling techniques.**

Completed for **SC/MATH 3430 – Sample Survey Methods** at York University.

---

## Data
- Survey of **100 York University students**
- Variables: GPA, study hours, sleep duration, screen time, stress level, exercise, lecture attendance

---

## Methodology
- Correlation analysis
- Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
- Stratified Sampling:
  - Proportional Allocation
  - Neyman Allocation
- Precision comparison via standard errors
- Data visualization using `ggplot2`

---

## Key Findings
- **Strongest negative factor:** Screen time  
- **Strongest positive factor:** Sleep duration  
- Balanced sleep, moderate study time, and low screen time are associated with higher GPAs  
- Stratified sampling (Neyman allocation) achieved higher precision than SRS
