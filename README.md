# Student Lifestyle & GPA Analysis (R)

## Overview
Statistical analysis of how university students’ lifestyle habits affect academic performance (GPA).
The project compares **Simple Random Sampling (SRS)** and **Stratified Sampling** to evaluate
estimation precision.

Completed for **SC/MATH 3430 – Sample Survey Methods** at York University.

## Data
- Survey of 100 York University students
- Variables include GPA, study hours, sleep, screen time, stress, exercise, and lecture attendance

---

## Methods
- Correlation analysis
- Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
- Stratified Sampling (Proportional & Neyman Allocation)
- Standard error comparison
- Data visualization with `ggplot2`

---

## Key Findings
- Strongest negative factor: **Screen time**
- Strongest positive factor: **Sleep**
- Balanced sleep, moderate study time, and low screen time are associated with higher GPAs
- Stratified sampling (Neyman allocation) provided higher precision than SRS
